## **Kaggle projects code**

This repository contains notebooks related to my 8th OpenClassrooms project.

During this project I worked on two kaggle contests.

The first notebook is a submission notebook for the "RSNA-MICCIA Brain Tumor
Radiogenomic Classification" contest.

The two others are related to the "Petfinder.my Pawpularity Contest".

First you have a quick data exploration notebook. Then a submission notebook.
